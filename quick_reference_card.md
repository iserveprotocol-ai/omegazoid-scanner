## 🛡️ Risk Management Rules

**The 1-2% Rule:** Never risk more than 1-2% per trade

**Position Size Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account Risk $) / (Entry - Stop Loss)
```

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 2% = $200
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $48
- Risk per share: $2
- Position: $200 / $2 = 100 shares

**Stop Loss Placement:**
- Below support levels
- Below moving averages
- Below swing lows
- 1.5-2x ATR below entry

**Profit Targets:**
- Minimum 2:1 risk-reward
- Previous resistance levels
- Fibonacci extensions (127%, 162%)
- Trail stop below 20 EMA
